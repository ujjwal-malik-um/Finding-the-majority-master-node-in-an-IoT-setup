# Finding-the-majority-master-node-in-an-IoT-setup
An IoT firm has a master-slave architecture with multiple sensor devices (having different ID and storage capacity), &amp; data being collected by them is going to a specific master node. The firm has not planned for load balancing, where some master nodes became overloaded as the number of sensors increased. We are handling overloaded master nodes
- [ ] a. Extracting sensor node, master node id's from excel file
- [ ] b. Linking sensor node to associated master node and counting number of links to a target master node
- [ ] c. Using divide & conquer approach to find master node with most assigned sensors
- [ ] d. Identifying nodes with a significant number of sensors (more than a third but less than half) as potential overload candidates
